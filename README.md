# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using supervised machine learning on a large real-world dataset containing over 6 million rows.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- SMOTE (imbalanced-learn)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ✅ What I Did
- Built and trained a fraud detection model using XGBoost on a large-scale transaction dataset
- Cleaned the dataset, encoded categorical variables, handled class imbalance with SMOTE, and applied scaling
- Evaluated model using ROC AUC, confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance
- Proposed actionable fraud prevention strategies based on insights from the model

## 📁 Files
- `Fraud_Detection_Aman_Yadav.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook
- `README.md`: Project overview

## 🚀 Outcome
The model achieved a strong ROC AUC score and high recall in predicting fraud, highlighting key indicators like transaction amount and account behavior.
